In the first half of this exercise, you will be using support vector machines
(SVMs) with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets
will help you gain an intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian
kernel with SVMs. In the next half of the exercise, you will be using support
vector machines to build a spam classifier.
The provided scripts, ex6.m and ex6_spam.m, will help you step through
the exercise.
