In this exercise, you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to perform
dimensionality reduction. You will first experiment with an example 2D
dataset to get intuition on how PCA works, and then use it on a bigger
dataset of 5000 face image dataset.
The provided script, ex7 pca.m, will help you step through the first half
of the exercise.
