In the first half of the exercise, you will implement regularized linear regres-
sion to predict the amount of water 
owing out of a dam using the change
of water level in a reservoir. In the next half, you will go through some diag-
nostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine the effects of bias v.s.
variance.
The provided script, ex5.m, will help you step through this exercise.
