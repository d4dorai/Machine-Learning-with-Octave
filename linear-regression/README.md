Ex. 1

In this part of this exercise, you will implement linear regression with one
variable to predict prots for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a
restaurant franchise and are considering dierent cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for
prots and populations from the cities.
You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand
to next.
